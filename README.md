# Prim and Kruskal Algorithms in C++ with Graph Matrices

Welcome to the implementation of the Prim and Kruskal algorithms in C++ for Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) calculations using graph matrices.

## Overview

This project provides efficient implementations of two well-known MST algorithms: Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm. These algorithms are applied to graphs represented as matrices, making them versatile for various applications.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and use the Prim and Kruskal algorithms with graph matrices in your C++ environment:

### Implementation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/afaq-ahmed07/Prim-and-Kruskal.git
    ```

2. Open the project in your preferred C++ development environment (e.g., Visual Studio, Code::Blocks).

3. Review the code and explore the implementations of Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms.

### Usage

1. To apply the Prim or Kruskal algorithm to a specific graph, instantiate the graph matrix within the code or provide it as input. Replace the sample graph with your own data or matrices.

2. Build and run the project.

3. The program will output the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for the given graph based on your chosen algorithm.

## Graph Representation

The project uses adjacency matrices to represent graphs. An adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to represent a finite graph. The rows and columns represent vertices, and the values in the matrix indicate the existence of edges between vertices.

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance or optimize the algorithms and their implementations are welcome. Feel free to submit pull requests and open issues for collaboration.


Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need assistance with implementing or customizing the algorithms for your specific graph and MST requirements.
